ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\src\main\java\
* assets\channel_hepaidai => app\src\main\resources\channel_hepaidai
* assets\pinyin\unicode2pinyin.txt => app\src\main\resources\pinyin\unicode2pinyin.txt
* assets\stock\stock.json => app\src\main\resources\stock\stock.json
* assets\webpage\ => app\src\main\java\
* assets\webpage\errorPage.html => app\src\main\resources\errorPage.html
* assets\webpage\img_errorhint.png => app\src\main\resources\img_errorhint.png
* assets\webpage\img_errorlogo.png => app\src\main\resources\img_errorlogo.png
* assets\webpage\web_error_network2.html => app\src\main\resources\web_error_network2.html
* lint.xml => app\lint.xml
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
